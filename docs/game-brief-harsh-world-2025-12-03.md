## Game Vision

### Core Concept

A hardcore survival simulator set in colonial North America where every decision about food preparation, water management, and shelter affects your health and stamina, and one mistake can mean death.

### Elevator Pitch

Harsh World is a 2D survival simulator where you manage complex survival needs—boiling water, preparing foraged foods, treating illnesses with plants, and balancing sleep comfort. Every decision matters: Do you hunt or forage? Do you fill your water bottle now? Is that mushroom safe? NPCs offer trades and warnings, but you're ultimately alone against nature's unforgiving rules.

### Vision Statement

Create a deeply realistic survival experience where players must master primitive survival knowledge to stay alive. Food isn't just calories—freshness matters, preparation matters, and eating the wrong thing gets you sick. The colonial setting and GPU-powered procedural world provide the backdrop, but the core experience is micromanaging survival against harsh nature. NPCs exist as functional trading partners and information sources, never as the focus. Every resource gathered, every meal prepared, every night's rest is a conscious decision with real consequences.

## Core Survival Mechanics

### Death & Respawn System
- **Permadeath:** When character dies, lose inventory but respawn at last saved settlement
- **World Reset:** Each death generates a completely new world (different seed)
- **Base Persistence:** Physical structures, storage, and supplies from the settlement remain in the new world
- **One-Way Respawning:** Old camps only exist as respawn points—can't travel back to them

### Food & Nutrition System
- **Food Diversity:** 20-30 food types (insects, plants, game, fish, etc.)
- **Preparation Methods:** Boiling, cooking, drying, fermenting—each affects nutritional value and freshness
- **Learning Discovery:**
  - Trial-and-error: Eat grub → learn it's food and its effects
  - Structured learning: Find books, talk to NPCs, or risk health learning through experimentation
- **Nutritional Complexity:** Specific minerals/proteins matter; side effects (constipation, vitamins, nutritional balance)
- **Seasonal Availability:**
  - Spring: Fish spawning
  - Summer: Berries, fresh vegetation
  - Winter: Preserved foods only, hunting focused
  - Direct impact on survival strategy across seasons

### NPC Economy & Trading
- **Required for Progression:** Complex items (steel pots, muskets, iron tools) can ONLY be obtained through:
  - Trading with NPCs
  - Finding in the world
  - **Cannot be crafted by player**
- **Multiple NPCs with Varied Needs:** Different NPCs want different resources and trade different items
- **Strategic Choice:** Player decides which NPC to trade with based on current needs and available resources

### Knowledge Mastery
- **Skill Discovery:** Experienced players know which plants heal, how to prepare meals, fire-building techniques
- **Experienced vs. Novice Gap:** Learning what works creates significant gameplay progression
- **Always Recoverable:** Mistakes are never permanent if player has knowledge/resources to fix them

## Game Fundamentals

### Core Gameplay Pillars

Harsh World is built on four foundational pillars that reinforce each other:

1. **Survival & Preparation**
   - Knowing what to pack for journeys
   - Maintaining fire, shelter, and camps
   - Learning survival techniques through discovery
   - Planning expeditions with meticulous care

2. **Food Scarcity**
   - Hunting, foraging, and fishing for survival
   - Managing food freshness and nutritional value
   - Preparing meals (boiling, cooking, preserving)
   - Water scarcity as secondary constraint
   - Seasonal food availability forcing strategy shifts

3. **Journey & Exploration**
   - Voyaging to distant NPCs and trading posts
   - Discovering new areas with rare resources
   - Encountering environmental hazards during travel
   - Managing supplies during multi-day expeditions
   - Risk vs. reward of venturing further

4. **Settlement & Building**
   - Creating secure base camps
   - Building storage for food preservation
   - Improving infrastructure (fire pits, crafting areas)
   - Safe haven to prepare for next journey
   - Persistent base across world resets

### Primary Player Actions

**Time Distribution (Early Game):**
- Forage and hunt: 25%
- Gather building resources: 25%
- Create and maintain fire, build settlement: 35%
- Prepare food: 10%
- Trade with NPCs: 5%

**Progression as skill increases:**
- Early: Focus on basic survival (food, fire, shelter)
- Mid: Thriving at survival, beginning exploration
- Late: Exploring map, discovering rare resources, accessing new NPCs

**The Expedition Loop:**
1. Gather resources at settlement (food, tools, materials)
2. Plan voyage (what to pack, which route, what to trade for)
3. Pack supplies (meticulous preparation = success)
4. Journey (manage resources, handle surprises)
5. Trade/Discover (accomplish objective, gather rare items)
6. Return safely (final test of preparation)
7. Improve settlement with discoveries
8. Repeat with more knowledge

### Player Experience Goals

Players should experience:

- **Tension** - "Do I have everything? Will this preparation be enough?"
- **Dread** - Seasonal change approaching (winter = harder survival)
- **Anticipation** - Planning the next voyage, knowing more than before
- **Joy** - Successful hunt or discovery ("I have food for weeks!")
- **Pride/Mastery** - "I survived because I prepared perfectly"
- **Discovery** - "Found a new area/resource/NPC!"
- **Vulnerability** - One mistake (forgot water, ate poison) = permadeath

This emotional arc drives repeated play: dread → preparation → success → pride → do it again.

## Reference Framework

### Inspiration Games & Mechanics

**Don't Starve**
- Taking: Permadeath + learning curve mechanic; survival needs system
- NOT Taking: Magic/fantasy elements (Harsh World is grounded in realism)

**Dwarf Fortress**
- Taking: Complex systems that reward mastery; failure states and consequences
- NOT Taking: ASCII art aesthetic or fortress-scale management

**Valheim**
- Taking: Base building/settlement mechanics; multiplayer foundation thinking
- NOT Taking: Combat focus or Norse mythology aesthetic

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors (Video Games):**
- **7 Days to Die** - Zombie survival, modern setting, crafting focused
- **Grounded** - Alice in Wonderland aesthetic, base building, sci-fi
- **Green Hell** - Jungle survival, psychological elements, modern
- **Rust** - Multiplayer PvP survival, modern, combat heavy
- **ARK: Survival Evolved** - Dinosaurs, sci-fi, action-heavy

**Inspiration from Media:**
- TV shows: "Alone," "Naked & Afraid," "Bear Grylls Survival" (realistic survival focus)

**Market Gap Identified:** Most survival games are fantasy (Valheim), modern/sci-fi (Rust, Grounded), or zombie-focused (7 Days to Die). None emphasize realistic survival with historical immersion.

### Key Differentiators

**What Makes Harsh World Genuinely Unique:**

1. **Realism as Core Design Philosophy**
   - Unlike fantasy games (Valheim, Grounded), Harsh World emphasizes authentic colonial-era survival
   - No magic, no sci-fi, no modern tools
   - Food prep, water sourcing, shelter are realistic constraints
   - Learning curve based on actual survival knowledge, not game mechanics

2. **Hydrology & Water Navigation**
   - UNIQUE mechanic not found in competitors
   - Procedurally generated rivers, streams, lakes
   - Canoe exploration as primary travel method
   - Water as strategic resource (drinking, fishing, crossing)
   - No other survival game integrates water systems this deeply

3. **17th Century Colonial/Pioneer Setting**
   - Specific historical period (not modern like Rust, not generic like 7 Days to Die)
   - Colonial North America provides cultural and narrative context
   - NPC traders represent historical trade routes
   - Seasonal survival mirrors actual historical challenges
   - Appeals to history-minded survival players

4. **Food Complexity + Knowledge-Based Progression**
   - 20-30 distinct food types vs. generic "food" in competitors
   - Preparation method matters (boiling, cooking, drying, fermenting)
   - Learning what's edible is gameplay, not just tutorial info
   - Nutritional specificity (proteins, minerals, side effects)
   - Rivals Don't Starve's depth but grounded in realism

5. **NPC Economy as Progression Gate**
   - Unlike most survival games, NPCs are REQUIRED for progression
   - Can't craft complex tools—must trade for them
   - Creates strategic resource-gathering (what does each NPC want?)
   - Reputation affects trade options
   - Multiplayer potential: shared economy in co-op

### Positioning Statement

**Why Harsh World Instead of Competitors:**

- **vs. Don't Starve:** More realistic, grounded survival; no fantasy elements; deeper food/nutrition mechanics; historical setting
- **vs. Rust:** Solo-friendly, cooperative, focused on survival mastery not PvP combat
- **vs. 7 Days to Die:** Historical immersion over zombie action; realism over combat
- **vs. Grounded:** Mature setting, realistic survival over whimsical sci-fi

**Target Player's Choice:** If you want hardcore survival realism with deep food mechanics, water navigation, and colonial history—all without combat focus—Harsh World is the only game offering this combination.

## Content Framework

### World & Setting

**Geographic Scope:**
- **Inspiration:** New France, but as a single island bounded by ocean
- **Island Size:** Large enough to require weeks of in-game travel to cross
- **Biome Diversity:**
  - Temperate forests
  - Deciduous forests
  - Boreal forests
  - Mountains
  - Coast/shoreline
  - Plains
  - Swamps
  - Tundra
  - Arctic regions
- **Procedural Generation:** Each new world (after permadeath) generates different island layout, forcing players to re-explore and rediscover locations

**Named Locations & Points of Interest:**
- Trading posts (colonial merchants, trappers)
- Native American villages and tribal territories
- Military forts (colonial outposts)
- Points of interest vary by biome (waterfalls, caves, resource hotspots)
- Locations must be discovered by players in each new world

**Cultural & Historical Elements:**
- **Native American tribes:** Multiple North American tribes with territorial control
- **Territorial mechanics:**
  - Encounter tribal members in their territory
  - Pay tribute, trade, or leave
  - Build reputation through positive interactions
  - Eventually gain access/welcome in territories
  - Language barriers affect trade deals and availability
- **Religious Groups (Post-Launch):**
  - Jesuits and Catholic missionaries (delayed to post-launch)
  - Territorial control and conversion mechanics
  - Conflict with native populations over land

### Narrative Approach

**Narrative Scope:** 5-10% of gameplay (flavor, not central)

**Story Structure:**
- **Emergent Narrative:** Stories arise from encounters and territorial interactions
- **Faction Reputation System:** Actions build reputation with tribes and colonial groups
- **Territorial Progression:** Players can advance from "outsider" to "welcomed" status through repeated positive interactions
- **No linear main quest:** Narrative is player-driven through exploration and faction relationships

**Narrative Delivery:**
- **Dialogue:** Minimal NPC dialogue, focused on trading and territorial negotiations
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Ruins, villages, forts, and resource signs tell history
- **Information from NPCs:** Trade merchants offer warnings ("Don't go north, bears aggressive") and information about other traders/resources
- **No cutscenes:** Narrative is integrated into gameplay encounters

**Narrative Complexity:** Simple, grounded in realism; no branching dialogue trees or complex questlines

### Content Volume & Encounter Design

**Discovery & Exploration:**
- **Encounter Rarity:** Specific numbers TBD through playtesting
- **Discovery Pattern:** Encounters rare enough to feel significant, not so common as to break immersion
- **Player Memory:** Key mechanic is remembering where trade posts are located for planning expeditions
- **Each New World:** Players must rediscover locations after permadeath (procedurally generated layout)

**Settlement Placement as Strategic Decision:**
- **Critical Gameplay Choice:** Where to build first settlement determines long-term survival success
- **Resource Proximity:** Access to food sources (hunting, foraging, fishing)
- **Water Access:** Proximity to body of water is HIGH PRIORITY (essential for drinking, fishing, canoe travel)
- **Climate Consideration:** Placement based on player skill:
  - New players: Easier climates (temperate forests, moderate weather)
  - Experienced players: Challenge climates (tundra, arctic, mountains)
- **Trade Post Proximity:** Players may choose to settle near trade posts for easier expeditions vs. remote settlements for isolation

**Trading Post Strategy:**
- Players encounter trade posts during exploration
- Remembering locations becomes valuable knowledge
- Settlement placement near trade posts reduces expedition prep time
- Alternatively, remote settlements force longer planning/provisioning for trade voyages

### Content Volume Estimates

**First Playthrough Duration:** ~30-50 hours (based on proficiency milestone at 20-30 hours)

**Replayability:**
- Procedural generation ensures different world layout each run
- Different settlement decisions based on new discoveries
- Reputation resets with new character (permadeath)
- Players develop meta-knowledge (where types of locations typically spawn) but each world is unique

**Post-Launch Expansion Opportunities:**
- Religious group territories and interactions
- Additional biomes and specialized locations
- More tribes and cultural interactions
- Quest systems (simple, not branching)

- **Language Barriers:** Text formatting conveys language difficulty (partially comprehensible text, accent markers)

### Production Approach

**Art Asset Creation:**
- **In-House:** Core character, core structures, player-created elements
- **Asset Store:** Licensed pixel art for supplementary assets (vegetation varieties, decorative objects)
- **Commission:** Professional artists for key visual moments or high-impact sprites, using in-house templates for style consistency
- **Quality Control:** All assets must fit historical setting and visual consistency

**Audio Production:**
- **Music Generation:** Suno AI with manual selection/curation for quality and mood appropriateness
- **Sound Effects:** Free-licensing libraries (institutional sources with comprehensive CC0/CC-BY licenses)
- **Post-Processing:** Minimal EQ/compression for game context (survival audio, not cinematic)

**Budget & Resource Allocation:**
- **Balanced Investment:** Art and audio receive equal priority
- **Efficiency:** Leverage free/low-cost tools (Suno, free sound libraries) to maximize quality without large budget
- **Scalability:** Production approach allows for commissioning artists post-funding without breaking existing asset pipeline

### Key Risks

**1. Technical Complexity (GPU Compute Shaders)**
- **Risk:** Godot 4.x GPU compute shader implementation is less documented than traditional rendering
- **Impact:** Delays in procedural terrain generation, potential performance bottlenecks
- **Probability:** Medium (Godot 4.x RenderingDevice API is newer; community resources limited)

**2. Solo Developer Bandwidth**
- **Risk:** Feature creep or underestimation of workload in areas like food system simulation, NPC behavior, world generation
- **Impact:** Extended development timeline; potential burnout
- **Probability:** High (solo dev with complex mechanics)

**3. Art Asset Pipeline (Pixel Art Scale)**
- **Risk:** Creating consistent pixel art across 16×16 to 256×256 resolutions is labor-intensive
- **Impact:** Delays in visual polish, potential inconsistency in aesthetic
- **Probability:** Medium-High (core solo dev task, no artist yet)

**4. Scope Management (MVP Definition)**
- **Risk:** Food system with 20-30 types, complex NPC economy, and large procedural world may exceed MVP boundaries
- **Impact:** Delayed launch; feature bloat
- **Probability:** Medium (temptation to add complexity beyond MVP 10 food types)

**5. Player Retention (Permadeath Mechanics)**
- **Risk:** High failure cost discourages casual players; may limit addressable market
- **Impact:** Smaller player base than soft-difficulty competitors
- **Probability:** High (intentional design choice, but inherent to genre)

### Technical Challenges

**GPU Compute Shader Reliability:**
- Challenge: Ensuring deterministic procedural generation works across different GPU brands/drivers
- Mitigation: Extensive testing across GPU families; reference implementation validation

**Performance Optimization (60 FPS Target):**
- Challenge: Maintaining frame rate with infinite procedural generation, complex food simulation, and water system
- Mitigation: GPU offload computation; streaming/chunking strategy; profiling-driven optimization

**Permadeath + World Reset Complexity:**
- Challenge: Persistence logic for settlements while regenerating world is complex state management
- Mitigation: Clear architectural separation of persistent vs. generated data; thorough testing of edge cases

### Market Risks

**Niche Audience (Hardcore Survival Only):**
- Challenge: Game explicitly targets experienced, mastery-driven players
- Market Impact: Smaller potential player base than broad-appeal survival games (Valheim, Grounded)
- Assumption: Quality and depth attracts dedicated playerbase sufficient for sustainable Early Access

**Permadeath Mechanics (Accessibility Barrier):**
- Challenge: One-shot failure prevents casual play; no "practice mode" option
- Market Impact: Players who dislike failure consequences will churn quickly
- Assumption: Target audience (ages 15-50+) *wants* high failure cost; this is differentiator, not limitation

**Crowded Survival Game Market:**
- Challenge: Survival games (7 Days to Die, Green Hell, Rust, Grounded, Valheim) have established communities
- Market Differentiation: Historical setting + water navigation + food complexity + knowledge-based progression creates unique niche
- Risk Mitigation: Community-driven marketing emphasizing historical authenticity

**Funding Uncertainty:**
- Challenge: Solo dev model is sustainable but limits scope; multiplayer roadmap requires team expansion
- Assumption: MVP success can attract publisher interest or Kickstarter funding
- Contingency: Game remains viable as solo project indefinitely; funding accelerates, not enables

### Mitigation Strategies

**Technical Risk Mitigation:**
1. **MVP Scope Locks:** Commit to 10 food types, 10 NPCs, single biome focus initially; expand post-launch
2. **Early GPU Testing:** Profile compute shader performance on target hardware NOW (before feature expansion)
3. **Iterative Architecture:** Design procedural generation for modularity; build foundation first, complexity later
4. **Community Feedback Loop:** Early Access allows real-world performance validation and optimization priorities

**Development Risk Mitigation:**
1. **Incremental Feature Implementation:** Complete survival loop → test → polish; add depth through iteration
2. **Burnout Prevention:** Schedule realistic milestones; accept post-launch content for secondary features
3. **External Support (Conditional):** If funding acquired post-MVP, hire artists and programmers to accelerate, not replace core design

**Market Risk Mitigation:**
1. **Positioning Clarity:** Market as "hardcore survival sim for mastery-driven players," not broad game
2. **Community Building:** Engage with survival game communities early; show development progress; gather feedback
3. **Accessibility Options:** Include difficulty sliders to allow broader appeal without compromising core experience
4. **Unique Value Proposition:** Lead with water navigation and food complexity; emphasize what competitors don't offer

**Funding/Timeline Risk Mitigation:**
1. **MVP-First Strategy:** Launch Early Access with core features; gather revenue and community feedback for roadmap
2. **Flexible Roadmap:** Co-op and seasonal mechanics are post-launch nice-to-haves, not blockers
3. **Open Funding Options:** Be prepared for publisher deals, Kickstarter, or investor conversations post-MVP success

- Position as Alternative to Valheim/Grounded for hardcore-only players
- Differentiation: "Historical realism + food complexity + water navigation = unique survival niche"
- Target players aged 25-45 (experienced gamers) first; broaden to 15-50 range through gameplay word-of-mouth

**Funding Next Steps (Conditional):**
- Successful Early Access (500+ concurrent players, positive reviews) → attracts publisher interest
- Alternative: Kickstarter campaign for co-op multiplayer (built on Early Access success)
- If neither: Continue solo development (sustainable; funding accelerates, not enables)

**First-Year Objectives:**
1. Launch Early Access and gather 6 months of player feedback
2. Refine core loop based on community insights
3. Expand food types and NPC content based on what players engage with
4. Publish clear co-op roadmap (demonstrates long-term vision)
5. Build community partnerships (streamers, content creators, history game communities)
6. Secure funding pathway for multiplayer expansion OR confirm solo continuation is viable

   - Goal: Establish foundation that supports later team expansion without major refactoring
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Deliverable: Technical architecture document (separate from this brief)

**Content Planning:**
4. **Food System Deep Dive**
   - Task: Create detailed specification of 10 MVP food types (nutrition, effects, preparation methods)
   - Goal: Establish balance targets and discovery flow
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   - Deliverable: Food system design spreadsheet (types, stats, NPC trading chains)

5. **NPC Economy Map**
   - Task: Define 10 NPCs with trading requirements and outputs
   - Goal: Ensure trade chains form coherent economy without dead-end trades
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Deliverable: NPC trading matrix (who wants what, who offers what)

6. **Biome Definition**
   - Task: Define 3-4 MVP biomes with unique resources and challenges
   - Goal: Establish visual guide for art/sprite creation
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Deliverable: Biome specification document (resources, visual palette, difficulty modifiers)

### Research Needs

**Historical & Cultural Accuracy:**
1. **17th Century Colonial North America Survival**
   - Research: Primary sources on food preservation, travel methods, trade routes in colonial period
   - Goal: Inform authentic mechanics (what actually worked for survival in era)
   - Sources: Historical societies, museum collections, academic articles
   - Impact: Validates realism claim; prevents anachronistic game design

2. **Indigenous Navigation & Water Use**
   - Research: Canoe design, river navigation techniques, seasonal water patterns in colonial period
   - Goal: Inform water system mechanics and canoe gameplay
   - Sources: Indigenous history resources, maritime history
   - Impact: Supports water navigation as core mechanic

3. **Regional Tribes & Territories**
   - Research: Accuracy of tribal placement, trade relationships, cultural interactions in New France era
   - Goal: Ensure respectful, accurate representation in-game
   - Sources: Indigenous communities, academic historians, cultural organizations
   - Impact: Builds credibility with cultural communities; avoids stereotyping

**Market & Player Validation:**
4. **Target Audience Interviews**

   - Goal: Validate that historical setting + food complexity appeals to audience
   - Method: Discord communities, Reddit, streamer outreach
   - Impact: Confirm market positioning; identify messaging

5. **Competitor Feature Gap Analysis**
   - Research: Deep dive into why competitors don't emphasize water navigation or food complexity
   - Goal: Understand if gap exists due to design choice or market oversight
   - Method: Play 7 Days to Die, Green Hell, Valheim; document design decisions
   - Impact: Validate that differentiators are actually valuable to players

### Open Questions

**Design Clarity Needed:**

1. **Difficulty Slider Scope**
   - Question: What exactly does "difficulty slider" affect? Health bar size? Food spoilage speed? NPC aggression?
   - Impact: Affects balance tuning and testing scope
   - Resolution: Define 3-4 difficulty levels and what adjusts for each

2. **Reputation Mechanics Detail**
   - Question: How does reputation decay? What actions increase/decrease it? Can player be permanently banned from tribe?
   - Impact: Affects NPC interaction gameplay depth
   - Resolution: Define specific reputation triggers and thresholds

3. **Water Crossing Mechanics**
   - Question: Can player cross rivers without canoe? What are consequences? Do canoes require repair/maintenance?
   - Impact: Affects world layout design (river placement as obstacle or opportunity)
   - Resolution: Specify river crossing rules and canoe mechanics

4. **Food Spoilage Timeline**
   - Question: How quickly does cooked food spoil vs. preserved? Does storage location matter (wet vs. cold)?
   - Impact: Affects settlement building choices and expedition planning
   - Resolution: Define spoilage rates for each food type

**Scope Decisions Pending:**

5. **Seasonal Mechanics in MVP?**
   - Question: Do seasons affect gameplay (food availability) in MVP or just visually?
   - Current Plan: Visual only in MVP; full mechanics post-launch
   - Resolution: Confirm this is correct scope boundary

6. **NPC Wandering vs. Stationary Split**
   - Question: What percentage of NPCs should wander vs. stay at fixed locations?
   - Current Plan: "Mix of stationary and wandering" - undefined ratio
   - Resolution: Define split (e.g., 60% stationary at trade posts, 40% wandering routes)

7. **Settlement Size Limit**
   - Question: Can player build unlimited structures or is settlement capped at certain size?
   - Impact: Affects late-game building gameplay
   - Resolution: Decide if MVP has growth ceiling

**Funding & Partnerships:**

8. **Publisher vs. Indie Path**
   - Question: Are you open to publisher deals pre-launch, or prefer full ownership?
   - Impact: Affects Early Access messaging and Kickstarter strategy
   - Resolution: Document stance on publishing partnerships

9. **Community Engagement Strategy**
   - Question: Will you maintain community channels (Discord, Reddit) during development or wait for launch?
   - Impact: Affects feedback gathering and marketing momentum
   - Resolution: Define community engagement timeline (alpha testing, tester recruitment, etc.)

## Executive Summary

**Harsh World** is a hardcore survival simulator set in colonial North America that prioritizes realistic, mechanics-driven gameplay over narrative spectacle. Every decision about food preparation, water management, and settlement placement directly impacts survival success, creating a deeply engaging experience for players who crave challenge and mastery-based progression.

### The Core Opportunity

The survival game market is crowded with fantasy (Valheim), modern (Rust), sci-fi (Grounded), and zombie-focused (7 Days to Die) entries. Yet **no mainstream survival game combines**:
- **Realistic historical immersion** (17th century colonial setting grounded in actual survival practices)
- **Deep food systems** (20-30 distinct food types with preparation methods, nutritional specificity, and freshness mechanics)
- **Water as core mechanic** (procedurally generated rivers, canoe navigation, hydrology as strategic resource)
- **Knowledge-based progression** (learning through discovery, not unlocking perks—experienced players are measurably better)
- **NPC economy gating** (must trade for complex tools, can't craft everything—forces strategic resource gathering)

This combination creates a unique market position: **For players aged 15-50+ who want hardcore survival realism with steep learning curves, Harsh World is the only game offering this integration.**

### Target Market & Business Model

**Primary Audience:** Experienced gamers (25-45) who love Dwarf Fortress complexity, Don't Starve permadeath, and mastery-driven progression. These players **want** high failure costs and complex systems to master.

**Launch Strategy:** Early Access single-player release focusing on core survival loop (forage, hunt, prepare food, build, trade). This de-risks development, gathers community feedback, and validates market fit before pursuing co-op multiplayer and funding.

**Revenue Model:**
- Early Access pricing (likely $19.99-29.99 range, following Don't Starve / Valheim precedent)
- Post-launch content updates (free for core features; cosmetic DLC if needed)
- Potential Kickstarter for co-op multiplayer phase
- Open to publisher partnerships if Early Access success warrants it

### MVP Scope & Timeline

**Launch Requirements:**
- Procedural terrain generation (GPU compute shaders required)
- 10 MVP food types with basic preparation (cooking, boiling, drying, fermenting)
- 10+ NPCs with functional trading system
- Permadeath + settlement persistence mechanics
- 3-4 core biomes, water system, basic building mechanics
- 60 FPS performance target

**Deferred to Post-Launch:**
- Full 20-30 food library, seasonal mechanics, religious group territories, platform ports, multiplayer

### Key Differentiators

1. **Realism is Gameplay** - No magic, no sci-fi, no modern tools. Food prep, water sourcing, shelter are mechanical constraints, not flavor.
2. **Hydrology Integration** - Water navigation, fishing, canoe travel, water scarcity create ecosystem competitors ignore.
3. **Historical Setting** - 17th century New France creates cultural context and appeals to history-engaged players.
4. **Food Complexity** - 20-30 types vs. generic "food"; preparation method, freshness, and nutrition directly affect gameplay.
5. **NPC Economy** - Required trading for progression creates strategic depth and replayability absent from competitors.

### Development Approach

**Solo Developer (JC) with Conditional Expansion:**
- Current: Personal savings funding; no external dependencies for MVP launch
- Post-Launch: Team expansion conditional on funding success (publisher, Kickstarter, or community support)
- Risk Mitigation: Game remains viable indefinitely as solo project; funding accelerates, not enables

**Technical Foundation:**
- Godot 4.x with GDScript
- GPU compute shaders for procedural generation (non-negotiable technical requirement)
- Chunk-based infinite terrain streaming (finite island bounded by ocean)
- Deterministic procedural generation (seed-based, reproducible worlds)

### Success Criteria

**Launch Goal (NOT breakout commercial success, but market validation):**
- 500+ concurrent players within first month
- 4.0+ star average review rating
- Core survival loop recognized as compelling by community
- Word-of-mouth: "Like Don't Starve meets Dwarf Fortress in colonial North America"

**Post-Launch (Months 3-6):**
- 1,000-2,000 active monthly players
- Community wiki/guides created by players
- Speedrun leaderboards active
- 5-10 content creators producing 100+ hours coverage
- Funding pathway identified or solo continuation confirmed as sustainable
